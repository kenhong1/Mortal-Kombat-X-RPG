# Mortal Kombat X RPG 


## Intro 

Your opponent and you both use the same machine and duel against each other to see who comes out on top as victor. Each character has a different set of attack and defend ratios, and each move has many different outcomes that can change the path of the game. 


## Characters 

 - LiuKang
   - Most balanced characeter, both of LiuKangs attack and defense are strong. Better for the novice type of fighter who wants to get a hang of the game. 
 - SubZero 
   - More on the defensive side of the spectrum. Focusing on his defensive aspect thus making his attacks a bit weaker, however; don't mistaken his lack of power as a drawback. 
 - Scorpion 
   - More on the attacking side of the spectrum. Focusing more on power and attack damage Scorpion lacks defense. Thus making this suitable for the well trained player
