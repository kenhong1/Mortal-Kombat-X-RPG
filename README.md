#Mortal Kombat X RPG 
*ReadMe*

##Intro 

In this game I created a turnbase style PVP game that was inspired by characters from Mortal Kombat X. There were many challenging parts of the game and it tested my knowledge of HTML, CSS, And mosty importantly Javascript. 


##How to Play

This game is created so two people can share 1 screen and go turn by turn until one of the players win. They have the chance to pick between 3 different characters who have all different damage/blocking ratios. Once the player as picked their choice of characters they must select a move and then click the "Fight" button. This will reveal the damage and this will be repeated until one character will be victorious. 

##Aspects of the Game 

I used many different formulas that I have leanred in the past 2 weeks of the class. Ranging from DOM Maniulation to creating functions within functions and calling them within different times. 

##Challenges

A of the challenge that arose for me was the reseting of the game feature. I was not able to apply a "real" reset button that would load all aspects back to a defult setting. Instead, I imported a reload feature that would reload the page. Other then that many times I came across small bugs, but that was due to spelling and incorrect ways to input functions.
